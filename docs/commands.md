## Tips & Tricks

### Batch Reviving Multiple Players

If you need to revive multiple dead players:

```bash
/psadmin revive Player1
/psadmin revive Player2
/psadmin revive Player3
```

Each revive will succeed independently.

### Checking Before Revival

Always check player status before reviving:

```bash
/pstatus DeadPlayer
# If output shows "Status: Dead", they can be revived
/revive DeadPlayer
```

### Grace Period Management

Monitor new players' grace periods:

```bash
/pstatus NewPlayer
# If grace remaining, they're protected from losing lives

# Extend grace if needed
/psadmin grace NewPlayer 48
```

### Limbo Visiting Restrictions

- - Living players can visit Limbo anytime
- - Living players can return to Main anytime  
- - Dead players cannot use `/leavelimbo`
- - Dead players cannot use `/limbo` to teleport away
- - Dead players must be revived to leave Limbo
